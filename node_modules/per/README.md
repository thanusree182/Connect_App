Composition/chaining for forward-passing transformer functions

Now re-written in TypeScript with a certain amount of dodgy stuff removed.

See [introductory blog post](https://smellegantcode.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/per-composable-forward-passing-processor-functions/)
for details, but note that version 2.0 is a little simpler - a number of features
have been removed (see tests.ts).
